# project
Computer Science final project

Implementation of two solutions (Neo4J and Tiledb) based on a production database implemented in postgresql that is part of EPOS-IP WP10.
Tested several queries to analyze their respective results in this specific scenario, and check which solution performs better.
Here I have the two solutions implementations as well as the scripts for the queries tested.

Tools used for data ingestion and query testing:
PostgreSQL - Pgadmin
Neo4j - Neo4j Desktop, Neo4j Browser
TileDB - python API


#Neo4J

\neo4j scripts implementation . contains the scripts for data ingestion, node and relationship creation for the the neo4j solution

\query scrripts\neo4j - contains the scripts for query performance testing in neo4j

#tileDB

\tiledb scripts implementation . contains the scripts for data ingestion and array creation for the tiledb solution

\query scrripts\neo4j - contains the scripts for query performance testing in tiledb

#PostgreSQL

\query scrripts\postgres - contains the scripts for query performance testing in postgres production database

#Performance testing

\query comparison - contains the screenshots of bar graphs with the results obtained
