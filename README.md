# project
Computer Science final project

Implementation of two solutions (Neo4J and Tiledb) based on a production database implemented in postgresql that is part of EPOS-IP WP10.
Tested several queries to analyze their respective results in this specific scenario, and check which solution performs better.
Here I have the two solutions implementations as well as the scripts for the queries tested.

Tools used for data ingestion and query testing:
PostgreSQL - Pgadmin
Neo4j - Neo4j Desktop, Neo4j Browser
TileDB - python API
